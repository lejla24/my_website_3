title: "Hiking Trips"
---

While I spent most of my life living in Vancouver, Canada, which is known for its spectacular natural scenery, it wasn't until the COVID-19 pandemic hit that I truly began to take advantage of this. Soon, I began embarking on several hiking and backpacking trips, both in the Vancouver area and outside of it.

This page is a compilation of a few of my favorite photos that I have taken on different hikes over the last two years.
