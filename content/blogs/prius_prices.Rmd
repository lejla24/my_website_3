A recent article in the UK claimed that [your Uber cab is most likely to be a Toyota Prius](https://www.motoringresearch.com/car-news/your-uber-cab-is-most-likely-to-be-a-toyota-prius-and-why-thats-a-good-thing/).

In this workshop, you will use a data file of prices for used Toyota Prius (collected in June 2018) to describe and analyse the dataset, and use your skills in 'telling a story with data'.

Your task is to carry out analyses of the relationships between price, mileage, colour, and model year for a selected type of car.

You are expected to use this template to create a report with tables, charts, and analysis that will help us understand what drives the price of a used Prius. For instance, you may find the following questions useful in your analysis:

- How much do cars cost?
-	How much do car prices vary my engine size, year, etc?
-	How are car prices associated with mileage? Age? Colour? Location?
-	How quickly do new cars depreciate?
-	How much does it cost to drive a car one extra mile?


# Summary statistics

```{r load-prius-data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

prius <- read_csv(here::here("data","toyota_prius_jun18.csv"))

skim(prius)
```

The data frame contains prices of used Toyota Prius in the UK that were gathered in June 2018. 

`town`, `region` and `colour` are categorical variables, whereas `miles` and `price` are numerical variables.

`year` and `engine` are treated as quantitative variables, but in reality are categorical variables.

```{r summarystats1}
prius <- prius %>% 
  mutate(
    engine = factor(engine),# turn it to a factor
    car_age = 2018- year 
  )

favstats(price ~ year, data=prius)

favstats(price ~ engine, data=prius)

favstats(price ~ colour, data=prius)


```


# 'Manual' calculations of confidence intervals for 2010 and 2011 mean prices

Note that the average value for a 2010 model is 6354, whereas a 2011 model goes on average for 8588. 

```{r}
# Calculate critical values for the t-distribution for a cumulative of 0.975, i.e., leaving 2.5% on one side

#For 2010 cars, since we have n=28 observations, we have 28-1 = 27 degrees of freedom
qt(0.975, 27)

#For 2011 cars, since we have n=13 observations, we have 13-1 = 12 degrees of freedom
qt(0.975, 12)

```

Lets look at the relationship between price of a prius and miles driven.

```{r, price_miles_scatter}
# plot scatter plot and add the best straight line
ggplot(prius, aes(x=miles, y = price))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_bw()+
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE)+
  NULL
```

# Linear Regression Model 

```{r, lm_models, warning = FALSE}
# run linear regression, lm model
model1 <- lm(price ~ miles, data = prius)

# get regression output table
model1 %>% 
  get_regression_table()

# get R Square
model1 %>% 
  get_regression_summaries()

# plot residuals
autoplot(model1) +
  theme_bw()

#add engine size, as a factor
model2 <- lm(price ~ miles + engine, data = prius)

# get regression output table
model2 %>% 
  get_regression_table()

# get R Square
model2 %>% 
  get_regression_summaries()

# plot residuals
autoplot(model2) + 
  theme_bw()


#add car age
model3 <- lm(price ~ miles + engine + car_age, data = prius)

# get regression output table
model3 %>% 
  get_regression_table()

# get R Square
model3 %>% 
  get_regression_summaries()

# plot residuals
autoplot(model3) + theme_bw()

# ________________________________________________________
#add colour and region
model4 <- lm(price ~ miles + engine + car_age + colour + region, data = prius)

# get regression output table
model4 %>% 
  get_regression_table()

# get R Square
model4 %>% 
  get_regression_summaries()

# plot residuals
autoplot(model4, which = 1:3) + theme_bw()

# no colours are significant. In addition, most regions are not significant, but let us just 
# mutate a new dummy variable "london" to see if london only has an impact

prius <- prius %>% 
  mutate(london = region=="London")

#add colour and dummy for london
model5 <- lm(price ~ miles + engine + car_age+ london, data = prius)

# get regression output table
model5 %>% 
  get_regression_table()

# get R Square
model5 %>% 
  get_regression_summaries()

# plot residuals
autoplot(model5, which = 1:3) + theme_bw()

```
