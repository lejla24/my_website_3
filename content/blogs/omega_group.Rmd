At the last board meeting of Omega Group Plc., the headquarters of a large multinational company, the issue was raised that women were being discriminated in the company, in the sense that the salaries were not the same for male and female executives. A quick analysis of a sample of 50 employees (of which 24 men and 26 women) revealed that the average salary for men was about 8,700 higher than for women. This seemed like a considerable difference, so it was decided that a further analysis of the company salaries was warranted. 

We will determine whether there is indeed a significant difference between the salaries of men and women, and whether the difference is due to discrimination or whether it is based on another, possibly valid, determining factor. 

```{r load_omega_data, include = FALSE}
omega <- read_csv(here::here("data", "omega.csv"))
glimpse(omega)
```

# Summary Statistics

First, let's calculate summary statistics on salary by gender. Then, we will also create and print a dataframe where, for each gender, we show the mean, SD, sample size, the t-critical, the SE, the margin of error, and the low/high endpoints of a 95% confidence interval.

```{r, confint_single_valiables}
omega_2<-mosaic::favstats (salary ~ gender, data=omega)
omega_2
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
male_female_df <- omega_2 %>%
  select(mean, sd,n, gender) %>%
  mutate(se=sd/sqrt(n),
  t = qt(0.975,n-1),
  margin =t*se,
  l_ci =mean - margin,
  h_ci = mean +margin) %>%
  select(gender, mean, sd, n, t, se, margin, l_ci, h_ci)

male_female_df
```

The 95% confidence intervals of the two genders overlap largely, meaning that there is now a need to run t-tests to determine whether these two means are different.

# Hypothesis testing

```{r, hypothesis_testing, fig.height=5, fig.width=8, message = FALSE}
t.test(salary~gender, data = omega) 

mean_dif <- omega %>% specify(salary~gender) %>% calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("male","female"))

set.seed(1234)
ratings_in_null_world <- omega %>%
  specify(salary~gender) %>% 
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps=1000, type="permute") %>%
  calculate(stat="diff in means", order = c("male","female")) 

ratings_in_null_world %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = mean_dif , direction = "two-sided")

p_value <- ratings_in_null_world%>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = mean_dif, direction = "two-sided")
p_value

```

From running this simulation, we see that the p-value is close to 0 (2e-04). This indicates that we should reject the null hypothesis and the difference in gender salary is indeed statistically different.

We can also get the same conclusion from looking at the t-statistic. In this case, the absolute value of t-statistic is higher than 2, thus we reject the null hypothesis.

The third way to confirm our conclusion is to look at the confidence interval. In this case, the CI does not contain zero, thus we reject the null hypothesis.
