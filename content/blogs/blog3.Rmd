At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6).


```{r read_GDP_data, include = FALSE}

UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

  
```


```{r reshape_GDP_data, include = FALSE}

tidy_GDP_data  <-  UN_GDP_data%>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = 4:51, names_to='years',values_to='components_GDP') %>% 
  mutate(components_GDP_billions =components_GDP/(1000000000) )

glimpse(tidy_GDP_data)
```

```{r,countries, include = FALSE}

```


Let us compare GDP components for 3 countries: India, China, and Germany.


# GDP components over time

```{r gdp1,  out.height="100%", include = FALSE}
GDPdata2 <- tidy_GDP_data
old_name<- c("Gross capital formation",
             "Exports of goods and services",
             "General government final consumption expenditure", 
             "Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)", 
             "Imports of goods and services")


new_name<- c( "Gross capital formation",
              "Exports",
              "Government expenditure",
              "Household expenditure",
              "Imports")


names(new_name) <-old_name
GDPdata2$IndicatorName <- new_name[GDPdata2$IndicatorName]
GDPdata2 <- GDPdata2 %>%
  na.omit(IndicatorName)
```


```{r gdp_drawing,fig.height=5, fig.width=8, results = TRUE}
GDP_components_over_time <- GDPdata2 %>% filter(Country %in% country_list) %>% group_by(IndicatorName)
#GDP_components_over_time <- GDP_components_over_time %>% filter(IndicatorName == 'Household expenditure')

ggplot(GDP_components_over_time, 
       aes(x=years,y=components_GDP_billions,colour = IndicatorName))+
  geom_line(aes(group=IndicatorName))+
  facet_wrap(~Country) +
  labs(title="GDP components over time", subtitle="In constant 2010 USD") +
  theme(axis.text=element_text(size=3))+
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = c(1970,1980,1990,2000,2010,2020))+
  theme_bw()
#+theme_minimal()
#+xlim(1970,2020)
```
The % difference between the GDP figure we calculated and that in the dataframe is 0.867%.


# GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US dollars

```{r gdp2, fig.height=5, fig.width=8}
GDP_components_over_time2 <- GDP_components_over_time %>%
  select(-components_GDP) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=IndicatorName,
              values_from = components_GDP_billions)

colnames(GDP_components_over_time2) <-c("CountryID","Country","years","Household_expenditure","Government_expenditure","Gross_capital_formation","Exports","Imports")

GDP_components_over_time3 <- GDP_components_over_time2 %>% 
  mutate(Net_exports=Exports-Imports,GDP_total=(Household_expenditure+Government_expenditure+Gross_capital_formation+Exports-Imports)) %>%
  select(-Exports,-Imports) %>%
  pivot_longer(4:7,names_to ="IndicatorName",values_to="GDP_components_billions") %>%
  mutate(Relative_value=GDP_components_billions/GDP_total)

ggplot(GDP_components_over_time3, 
       aes(x=years,y=Relative_value, colour=IndicatorName, group=IndicatorName)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(~Country) + 
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = c(1970,1980,1990,2000,2010,2020)) +

  labs(title = "GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars", x="years")
```


The chart above shows us a clear breakdown of GDP from 1970 to 2020 spread across 4 key categories - Government Expenses, Gross Capital Formation, House Expenses and Net Exports. 

In case of House Expenditure, Germany sees a fairly constant trend over the years while the trend is extremely volatile in case of India and US. India sees a ~15pp drop in the b category while US sees a ~10pp rise. A very similar, but inverted trend is seen in case of the Gross Capital Formation. 

Germany sees a minor drop over the years in this category while India sees a major jump, almost 20pp from 1970 to 2010 after which it drops a bit. The United States trend for the Gross Capital Formation is fairly flat at ~20% with very little variation over the years. The lowest two categories - Government Expenditure and Net Exports see mostly flat trends too. The net exports are almost 0% in all three regions - India, Germany and United States. The line for Government Expenditure is constant for Germany and India, while it sees a declining trend in case of United States.
