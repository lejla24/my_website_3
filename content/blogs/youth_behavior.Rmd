title: IMDB Differences between directors
---

Recall the IMBD ratings data. I would like you to explore whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. I have already calculated the confidence intervals for the mean ratings of these two directors and as you can see they overlap. 

Null Hypothesis: IMDB mean rating is the same for SS and TB. difference in m =0
Alternative hypothesis: difference in mean is not equal to 0.
t-stat: difference between mean divided by standard error
p-value


```{r load-movies-data,fig.height=5, fig.width=8 }
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
#glimpse(movies)

movies_2 <- movies %>% 
  group_by(director) %>% 
  filter(director %in% c("Steven Spielberg","Tim Burton")) %>% 
  summarise(rating,mean_rating = mean(rating), #find datapoints needed for t distribution.
         sd_rating = sd(rating),
         count=n(),
         t_critical =qt(0.975,count-1),
         se_rating = sd(rating)/sqrt(count),
         margin_of_error = t_critical*se_rating, 
         rating_low = mean_rating - margin_of_error, 
         rating_high = mean_rating +margin_of_error,
         highest_rating =max(rating),
         lowest_rating = min(rating))

#movies_mean<-count(movies, mean_rating) 
#movies_mean
movies_2

  ggplot(movies_2, aes(x = mean_rating,y = director))+
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(data = movies_2,aes(xmin = rating_low, xmax=rating_high,height=0.2), size = 1, height = 0.1)+
  labs(x = "Mean IMDB Rating",title = "Do Spielburg and Burton have the same mean IMDB rating",subtitle="95% confidence interval overlap")+
    geom_rect(aes(xmin=7.27, xmax= 7.33, ymin=0, ymax=3),
            fill = "grey70",
            alpha = 0.5)+
    theme_minimal()#+
   # geom_text(aes(x= mean_rating, label = labels), vjust=0, nudge_y =0.05,overlap=FALSE)
  #geom_text(label=mean)
  #theme_bw()
